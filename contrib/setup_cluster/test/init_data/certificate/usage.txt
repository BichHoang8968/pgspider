1. Description
  
The certificate is used for both Redmine and Gitlab server.
The common name of the certificate must match with the address/name of the server.
For example, if accessing to https://127.0.0.1/redmine, the common name of the certificate must be 127.0.0.1.
If accessing to https://wwww.redmine.com/redmine, the common name of the certificate must be www.redmine.com
So, depending on the server address/name, we need to select/create suitable certificate
  
2. How to create certificate

Execute the following command:
openssl req  -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certificate_local.key -days 3650 -out certificate_local.crt

Then enter information, in which set the common name as described above. For example,
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:127.0.0.1
